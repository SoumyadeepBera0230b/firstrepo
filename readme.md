Firstly i had installed the latest version of git of 50mb

Then i had verified if git completely installed or not by typing "git --version"

Now i had created a folder and a file in it named as learn git and files are index.html, style.css, and readme.md

To add the folder into the repo we use the following comand "git init". So the dublicate folder has been created in the git repository of the folder learn git

To check the status of your file, we use the command "git status"

So the folder has been tracked by the git but the files inside it are not added to git repository 

To add the files of the folder to the repository we use the command "git add index.html"
